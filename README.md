Step Sequencer in JS and HTML5
====

No readme yet, just source code.

Run the python server in a virtualenv (note requirements.txt), but all
the juicy stuff happens in Javascript. Borrowed a lot of stuff from
http://galacticmilk.com/midi-js/Basic.html
and
http://galacticmilk.com/midi-js/, many thanks to the developers of
the HTML5 MIDI stuff therein.
